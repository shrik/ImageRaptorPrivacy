## Image Raptor
### Data Access by Image Raptor
To enable the extraction of images from web pages, the Image Raptor extension requires access to the entire content of the web page when you click on its icon.

Additionally, for certain websites like Instagram, which restrict external access to their content, Image Raptor mimics requests for images as if they were originating from the website itself.

### Utilization of Collected Data
Image Raptor solely utilizes the extracted information to present the images within a popup window, facilitating their download. The downloading process operates in the background, allowing you to close the extension without interruption.

Furthermore, Image Raptor stores specific settings locally within your browser. This stored data is automatically deleted when you uninstall the extension.

### Data Sharing by Image Raptor
It's important to note that Image Raptor does not alter, retain, transmit, or commercialize your data in any manner. No data is transmitted from your computer!
