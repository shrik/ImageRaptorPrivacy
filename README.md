## Image Downloader
### What information does Image Downloader access?
In order to extract images from a web page, the extension needs to read all the content on that web page when you click the extension icon. 

In addition, some websites like Instagram try to prevent access to their content from the outside, so upon opening the popup Image Raptor will request the images as if they're coming from the website itself. 

### How does Image Downloader use that information?
Image Raptor only uses the extracted information to display the images in a popup, then download them. The downloads run in the background so you don't need to keep the extension open. 

Also, Image Raptor stores some settings locally in your browser. The stored data is automatically removed if you uninstall the extension.

### Does Image Raptor share any information?
The extension does not modify, store, send, or sell your data in any way! No data leaves your computer!

## Code Blue
### What information does Code Blue access?
In order to render code blocks in a tweet, the extension needs to read all the content of the page when you open twitter.com - it does not have access to any other domains. 

### How does Code  use that information?
Code  only uses the extracted information to process code blocks starting with ``` in tweets, then replaces the original tweet HTML with the processed HTML, providing syntax highlighting for code and rendering math formulae using LaTeX.
